This is a test case for the human nasal cavity described in 
Inthavong, et al. 2017 (find rest of citation here)

The "boundary file" uses information from the TECPLOT file those authors provided

This contains:
 - allBdy3D - boundary segments in 3D, corresponds to coordinates from original file (but down sampled)
 - allBdy2D - boundary segments in 2D, specific to a UV-file (this is important!)
 - sourcefile - name of the UV-file whose 2D coordinates were the reference in creating allBdy2D
 - zoInfo - Contains (1) names of each region and (2) number of faces in each region
